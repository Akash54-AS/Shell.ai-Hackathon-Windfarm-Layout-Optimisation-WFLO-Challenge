# Shell.ai Hackathon Windfarm Layout Optimisation (WFLO) Challenge

In this hackathon, the challenge is to optimize the placement of Nturb , 50 wind turbines of 100 m rotor diameter and 100 m height each on a hypothetical 2D offshore wind farm area such that the AEP (Annual Energy Production) of the farm is maximized. The farm area for this problem is square in shape having dimensions: length Lx = 4 km, width Ly = 4 km. The orientation of farm is such that one of its edges is parallel to the geographical North direction. See Figure 1. There it can be assumed that the positive y and x axis shown are aligned with the geographical North and East directions respectively. There are two constraints that must not be violated by a wind farm layout to be con- sidered valid.

- Perimeter Constraint --> All the turbines must be located inside the perimeter of the farm, while maintaining a minimum clearance of 50 meters from the farm boundary.
- Proximity Constraint --> The distance between any two turbines must be larger than a given security threshold to ensure a longer lifetime of the turbine rotors. This minimum distance between two turbines is called Dmin and needs to be 400 m.
